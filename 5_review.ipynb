       "\"Here's a traditional recipe for making croissants:\\n\\n**Ingredients:**\\n\\nFor the dough:\\n\\n1. 1 cup warm milk (105°F to 115°F)\\n2. 1/4 cup granulated sugar\\n3. 2 teaspoons active dry yeast\\n4. 3 cups all-purpose flour\\n5. 1 teaspoon salt\\n6. 1/4 cup unsalted butter, melted\\n\\nFor the butter block:\\n\\n7. 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened\\n8. 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar\\n9. 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n**Step 1: Make the dough**\\n\\n10. In a small bowl, combine warm milk and sugar. Sprinkle yeast over the mixture and let it sit for 5-10 minutes, until frothy.\\n11. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, salt, and melted butter. Add yeast mixture to the dry ingredients and mix until a shaggy dough forms.\\n12. Knead the dough for 10-12 minutes, until smooth and elastic.\\n\\n**Step 2: Rest the dough**\\n\\n14. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with plastic wrap or a damp towel, and let it rest in a warm place for 1 hour, until doubled in size.\\n15. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\\n\\n**Step 3: Make the butter block**\\n\\n16. In a separate bowl, mix together softened butter, confectioners' sugar, and vanilla extract until crumbly.\\n17. Roll the butter mixture into a rectangle, about 1/2-inch thick.\\n\\n**Step 4: Laminate the dough**\\n\\n20. Roll out the rested dough to a large rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.\\n21. Place the butter block on top of the dough, making sure it's centered and evenly spread.\\n22. Fold the dough over the butter block, like a letter (fold in thirds, then in half again).\\n23. Rotate the dough 90°, so the folded edge is facing you.\\n\\n**Step 5: Laminate again**\\n\\n26. Roll out the dough to a large rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.\\n27. Repeat step 22 and 23, folding and rotating the dough three more times.\\n\\n**Step 6: Cut and shape croissants**\\n\\n30. After the final fold, roll out the dough to a large rectangle, about 1/4-inch thick.\\n31. Use a pastry cutter or a sharp knife to cut the dough into long, thin triangles.\\n32. Roll each triangle into a croissant shape, curving the ends towards each other.\\n\\n**Step 7: Proof and bake**\\n\\n34. Place the croissants on the prepared baking sheets, leaving about 1 inch of space between each pastry.\\n35. Cover with plastic wrap or a damp towel and let proof for 1 hour, until doubled in size.\\n36. Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C). Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden brown.\\n\\n**Tips:**\\n\\n* Keep the butter cold and handle the dough gently to prevent it from becoming too sticky.\\n* Don't overwork the dough or the butter block will become tough.\\n* Let the croissants proof long enough to allow them to rise, but not so long that they get soggy.\\n\\nNote: Making croissants can be a bit tricky, and practice makes perfect. Don't be discouraged if your first batch doesn't turn out perfectly – with time and practice, you'll get the hang of it!\""
